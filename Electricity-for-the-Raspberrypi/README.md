# Electricity for the Raspberry Pi

## Go With the Flow (of electrons)

Electricity is a vast topic with many laws, components, and behaviors. In this module, we cover the need-to-know topics of electronic circuits so you can start controlling the world with the Raspberry Pi.

This module will cover the following topics:

- Electric circuits and how to represent them using schematics
- Voltage, current, and resistance and how they are all related
- The math behind electricity using Ohmâ€™s law
- Designing and documenting a basic LED circuit using a schematic
