Congratulations! Using the command line, you’ve learned how to navigate and manipulate the filesystem. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories (subdirectories) and files.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
pwd outputs the name of the current working directory
ls lists all files and directories in the working directory
cd switches you into the directory you specify
mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory
Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories
